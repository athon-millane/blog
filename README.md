# Blog dev

## Install

The blog is built using Hugo. If you use Homebrew install Hugo with:

```
brew install hugo
```

Otherwise read Hugo's [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

Clone this repo. `CD` into the repo and run:

```
hugo server
```

This runs a local version of the blog at `localhost:1313`. It will automatically update as you make changes.
