Last Friday, Hilary joined Ira Flatow on Science Friday in the studio to discuss the question:<a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/06/12/2015/will-our-smartphones-know-us-better-than-ourselves.html">Â Will Our Smartphones Know Us Better Than Ourselves?</a>

We love imagining what our future may look like with the technology we are building.
