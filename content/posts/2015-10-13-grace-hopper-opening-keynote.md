You can catch the keynote live at <b>9:30 EDT / 8:30 CDT</b> on the conference <a href="http://gracehopper.anitaborg.org/conference-overview/livestream-schedule-2015/wednesday-livestream-2015/">livestream website</a>. </p><p>As a brief preview, Hilary’s talk will cover: how and why machine intelligence is revolutionizing computing; what today’s tech ecosystem looks like and how aspiring female technologists have to maneuver to succeed (be that landing the right job or starting a company); and how Fast Forward Labs is an example of a “hack” of the system, rethinking the future of applied research. </p><p>We are extremely proud that Hilary serves as a role model for women in technology. Commodore Hopper put it best: </p>

> “The most important thing I&rsquo;ve accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, &lsquo;Do you think we can do this?&rsquo; I say, &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo; And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don&rsquo;t forget to take chances.”
