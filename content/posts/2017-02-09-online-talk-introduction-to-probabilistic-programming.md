On Tuesday, we hosted an online talk with the [Stan Group](http://stan.fit/) discussing why probabilistic programming is generating so much excitement in the fields of machine learning and statistics. In essence, probabilistic programming is a powerful tool to help organizations make rational decisions under uncertainty.

Watching the recording, you will learn:

- What kinds of problems are a good fit for Bayesian inference
- How a model-centric approach changes data science workflows
- How to use probabilistic programming for revenue models
- What Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is and why it's tricky to use
- What Stan is, what it does well, and what its limitations are
- What weâ€™re excited about in the near future

This online talk part of a series of educational resources accompanying our [recent research on probabilistic programming](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/18/new-research-on-probabilistic-programming.html). Our research dives deeper into the topic, teaching readers how to build products using Bayesian inference models. To learn more, write to us at [cffl@cloudera.com](mailto:cffl@cloudera.com).
