##### Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token "subordinate .." is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question "Macedonia was under the rule of which country?". This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

Semantic search is useful across many business application domains and data types.
Semantic search relies on the existence of a representation of eaech data item which encodes semantic meaning.

For example, the following problems can be cast as a semnatic search problem: identifying fraudulent signatures, recommending the right fashion elements,

While this remains an interesting area, constructing the right representation remains a difficult challenge. In this post, we will review three methods for extracting representations.
