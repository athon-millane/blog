  <h1>FairML: Auditing Black-Box Predictive Models</h1>
  <p><img src="/images/2017/03/fairness_and_justice_symbol.png" alt="Fairness in ML"></p>
<p>Machine learning models are used for <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23180">important decisions</a>
like <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Angele%20Christin.pdf">determining who has access to bail</a>.
The aim is to increase efficiency and spot patterns in data that humans would otherwise miss.
But how do we know if a machine learning model is fair? And what does fairness in machine learning mean?</p>
<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore these questions using
<a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml">FairML</a>, a new Python library that audits
black-box predictive models and is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04967">work I did with my advisor while
at MIT</a>. We&rsquo;ll apply it to a hypothetical
risk model based on data collected by ProPublica in their investigation of the
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">COMPAS
algorithm</a>.
We&rsquo;ll also go over the methodology behind FairML at a conceptual level and
describe other work addressing bias in machine learning.</p>
<p>This post is a prelude to our upcoming research report and prototype on algorithmic interpretability, which we&rsquo;ll release in the next few months. Understanding how algorithms use inputs to inform outputs is, in certain instances, a condition for organizations to adopt machine learning systems. This is particularly salient when algorithms are used for sensitive use cases, like criminal sentencing.</p>
<h2 id="recidivism--propublica">Recidivism &amp; ProPublica</h2>
<p>Until recently, judges and legal professionals were the sole arbiters deciding whether to release someone on bail. Legislation and other
checks that limit discrimination in this process are designed with
human biases in mind. As algorithms influence&ndash;or even take over&ndash;these types of decisions, it
is not clear how to audit the process for fairness and
discrimination.</p>
<p>Police and legal professionals in states like Virginia, Arizona, and Florida now use scores from the COMPAS algorithm to support decisions about who to set free, typically regarding bail and/or sentencing. The makers claim the COMPAS algorithm can
fairly predict whether a person will re-offend.
The exact details and methodology of the COMPAS algorithm are not publicly
available, but <a href="http://criminology.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Validation-of-the-COMPAS-Risk-Assessment-Classification-Instrument.pdf">several</a>
<a href="http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/technical_documents/FieldGuide2_081412.pdf">studies</a>
have assessed its performance.</p>
<p>In a recent investigation, ProPublica analyzed the risk scores produced by
the <a href="(https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm)">COMPAS model</a>
for about 7000 individuals in Broward County, Florida and found that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[COMPAS] correctly predicts recidivism 61 percent of the time. But blacks are
almost twice as likely as whites to be labeled a higher risk but not actually
re-offend. It makes the opposite mistake among whites: they are much more
likely than blacks to be labeled lower risk but go on to commit other crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="multicollinearity-and-indirect-effects">Multicollinearity and Indirect Effects</h2>
<p>In its investigation, ProPublica ran <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm">several regression
models</a>
to quantify how COMPAS risk scores depend on race and other factors.
Regressions allow one to use the magnitude and sign of the
coefficient estimate obtained as a measure of an model&rsquo;s dependence
on particular attributes. However, indirect effects might still not
be accounted for if the attributes used in the regression are co-linear.</p>
<p>The variance inflation factor (VIF) allows us to quantify multicollinearity before
running a regression. Despite low VIF scores, a variable correlated with other attributes -even midly-
used in the regression can still have indirect effects. Consequently, we need a way to properly account for
the issue of <strong>multicollinearity</strong> and <strong>indirect effects</strong> for black-box
models. FairML provides this capability.</p>
<h2 id="audit-of-a-proxy-model">Audit of a Proxy Model</h2>
<p>While used for public sentencing, Northpointe&rsquo;s COMPAS risk assessment
algorithm is proprietary, so ProPublica was not able to directly examine its model.
Instead, ProPublica manually collected data on the COMPAS risk scores
for thousands of cases in Broward, County FL. Using this data, they built
regression models that measure the relationship between race and the
risk scores COMPAS produces.</p>
<p>For our audit, we used a proxy model. We built a logistic
regression proxy model using the attributes collected by ProPublica
and assumed this model was an oracle, i.e., a <em>reasonable</em> approximation of the
COMPAS model.  We then audit this proxy model for bias using FairML. As a
sanity check, we also built more sophisticated models using the ProPublica
data, and our conclusions remain the same.</p>
<h2 id="fairml">FairML</h2>
<h3 id="perturbation">Perturbation</h3>
<p>The basic idea behind FairML (and many other attempts to audit or interpret model behavior)
is to measure a model&rsquo;s dependence on its inputs by
changing them. If a small change to an input feature dramatically changes the output,
the model is sensitive to the feature.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we have a predictive model of income that takes as input
attributes age, occupation, and educational level. One way of determining the
model&rsquo;s dependence on age is to see how much the model&rsquo;s prediction of an
individual&rsquo;s income changes if the individual&rsquo;s age is slightly <strong>perturbed</strong>.
If the model places high importance on age, then a slight change would result in
a big change to the prediction.</p>
<p>But what if the input attributes are correlated? This is certainly true of age
and education: there aren&rsquo;t many 16-year olds with PhDs! This means that perturbing
age alone will not provide an accurate measure
of the model&rsquo;s dependency on age. One has to perturb the other input
attributes as well.</p>
<h3 id="orthogonal-projection-as-a-perturbation-scheme">Orthogonal Projection as a Perturbation Scheme</h3>
<p>The trick FairML uses to counter this multicollinearity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)">orthogonal</a>
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases/orthogonal-projections/v/linear-algebra-projections-onto-subspaces">projection</a>.
FairML orthogonally projects the input to measure the
dependence of the predictive model on each attribute.</p>
<p>Why does this help? Orthogonal projection is a type of vector projection.
A projection maps one vector onto another. If you project a vector <strong>a</strong>
onto vector <strong>b</strong>, then you get the component of vector <strong>a</strong>
that lies in the direction of vector <strong>b</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/fairml-01.png" alt="Orthogonal Projection Demonstration"></p>
<p>An orthogonal projection is a particular type of vector projection that maps a
vector onto a direction orthogonal (or perpendicular) to reference vector. For
example, if we orthogonally project vector <strong>v</strong> onto <strong>s</strong> (in Euclidean
space), we get the component of vector <strong>v</strong> that is at perpendicular to vector
<strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/fairml-02.png" alt="Orthogonal Projection Demonstration"></p>
<p>Orthogonal projection of vectors is important for FairML because it allows us to
completely remove the linear dependence between attributes. If two vectors
are orthogonal to one another, then no <strong>linear transformation</strong> of one vector can
produce the other. This intuition underlies the feature dependence measure
in FairML.</p>
<p>More concretely, if we have a model, <strong>F</strong>, trained on two features <strong>x</strong> and
<strong>y</strong>, the dependence of model <strong>F</strong> on <strong>x</strong> is determined by quantifying the
change in output on a transformed input. This transformed input perturbs <strong>x</strong>, and the other feature <strong>y</strong> is made orthogonal to
<strong>x</strong>.</p>
<p>The change in output between the perturbed input and the original input
indicates the dependence of the model on a given attribute, and we can be
confident that there are no hidden collinearity effects.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/fairml-03.png" alt="FairML Process Diagram" title="FairML Process Diagram"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with vector projection, you may note that orthogonal
projection is a linear transformation. This means it does not account for
non-linear dependence among attributes. This is a valid concern. FairML
accounts for this by a basis expansion and a greedy search over such
expansions (<a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/tree/master/doc/thesis_document">see chapter 4 of thesis</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/fairml/non_linear_expansion.py">FairML repo</a>).</p>
<h2 id="fairml---demo">FairML - Demo</h2>
<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s how to use the FairML Python package to audit a
black-box model using the <code>audit_model</code> function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> fairml <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> audit_model
</code></pre></div><p><code>audit_model</code> takes two required arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A function that classifies data, i.e., the model of interest.</li>
<li>Sample data to be perturbed by the querying function (a pandas DataFrame
with no missing data). This sample data should represent
data the model will encounter in the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also takes optional keywords that control the mechanics of the auditing
process, including</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of iterations to perform</li>
<li>a Boolean flag to enable/disable checking model dependence on interactions</li>
<li>distance metric to to quantify dependence.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml">FairML</a> repository for a more
detailed explanation of how these parameters affect the auditing process.</p>
<p><code>audit_model</code> returns a dictionary whose keys are the column names of the input
pandas DataFrame and whose values are lists containing model dependence on that
particular feature for each iteration performed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use scikit-learn to make a model for FairML to audit. We&rsquo;re using a
<code>LogisticRegression</code> model here, but one advantage of FairML is that it can audit any
classifier or regressor. FairML only requires that it has a
predict function.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>As a convenience, FairML includes a basic plotting function to visualize these
dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> fairml <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> plot_dependencies

)
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it. FairML allows us to quickly perform an end-to-end audit of a model
simply by passing in a predict method and sample data.</p>
<h2 id="auditing-compas">Auditing COMPAS</h2>
<p>Now that we know how FairML works, let&rsquo;s use it to audit a hypothetical COMPAS
model. Here&rsquo;s the output of the demo code above.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/fairml_propublica_linear_direct_v2.png" alt="Fairness in ML"></p>
<h5 id="relative-feature-dependence-ranking-obtained-from-fariml-red-indicates-that-the-factor-highly-contributes-to-a-high-recidivism-rating-by-compas-note-we-omit-the-intercept-term">Relative feature dependence ranking obtained from FariML. Red indicates that the factor highly contributes to a high recidivism rating by COMPAS. Note: We omit the intercept term.</h5>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the dependence above with that of the logistic regression model
obtained in ProPublica&rsquo;s analysis. Below, we show a bar chart of each attribute
and then feature dependence obtained in the two analyses.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/propublica_vs_fairml_feature_dependence.png" alt="Fairness in ML"></p>
<h5 id="relative-ranking-of-logistic-regression-coefficients-obtained-by-propublica-red-indicates-that-the-factor-highly-contributes-to-a-high-recidivism-rating-by-compas-note-we-omit-the-intercept-term">Relative ranking of Logistic Regression Coefficients obtained by ProPublica. Red indicates that the factor highly contributes to a high recidivism rating by COMPAS. Note: We omit the intercept term.</h5>
<p>The crucial point to note is: when we account for multicollinearity using
FairML, we actually strengthen ProPublica&rsquo;s claim of bias against
African Americans, i.e., we see that the model&rsquo;s dependence on that attribute
increases. FairML shows that the most significant variable is the number of
priors an individual has, but this is followed by the attribute
African American. In their analysis, ProPublica found that the importance of the
African American attribute was not as strong as attributes such as Age, Native
American, and Past Recidivism, which differs from the result of our audit.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, our audit results are for the proxy
logistic regression model similar to ProPublica&rsquo;s proxy
model. While this audit is not of the original COMPAS model, we, like ProPublica, take the proxy
model as an reasonable approximation. Ultimately, to
make concrete conclusions, we&rsquo;ll need access to the COMPAS model. We also built
other <a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/example_non_linear_models.py">more complicated
models</a>
based on this data and audited them. <a href="https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/doc/images/feature_dependence_plot_fairml_random_forest.png">Our
results</a>
are consistent with the  graph shown above.</p>
<h2 id="other-work">Other Work</h2>
<p>There are many other examples of research about auditing black-box models. All use input perturbation to
measure attribute influence on a black-box model, but use different strategies to perturb the input. Two
projects stand out: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07043">Adler et al. also propose a data perturbation
method</a> (whose <a href="https://github.com/algofairness/BlackBoxAuditing">open source code is
available</a>) and <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546525/">Datta et.
al.</a>
attack the problem of auditing black-box models.</p>
<p>Beyond auditing black box models, the research on fairness and discrimination
in machine learning has become a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3913">hot button
issue</a>. The <a href="http://www.fatml.org/">Fairness, Accountability and
Transparency in Machine Learning</a> community is active
and dedicated to this line of research. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413">Recent work</a>
has articulated <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/rawlsbandits.html">new definitions of
fairness</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807">the
inherent tradeoffs</a> that different notions of
fairness lead to.</p>
<p>Governments and international organizations have become increasingly concerned
about algorithmic decision-making too. In fact, the EU recently adopted a
resolution that allows for a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813">&lsquo;right to
explanation&rsquo;</a> of algorithmic decisions that
&lsquo;significantly&rsquo; affect an individual. The United States White House has also
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">published</a>
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/preparing_for_the_future_of_ai.pdf">several reports
on</a>
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2016_0504_data_discrimination.pdf">big data and
discrimination</a>.
Developing and deploying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565">&lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; in a safe
manner</a> is becoming topical among
researchers, industry, and government. Going forward, there seems to be
dedicated effort on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/linkedin-cofounder-reid-hoffman-omidyar-network-create-27-million-fund-for-ai-in-the-public-interest/">multiple
fronts</a>
to tackle this issue.</p>
