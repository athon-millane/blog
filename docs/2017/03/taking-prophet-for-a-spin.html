  <h1>Taking Prophet for a Spin</h1>
  <p>Facebook recently released
<a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a>, a general purpose time
series forecasting package with both Python and R interfaces.</p>
<p>Python and R already have plenty of time series forecasting options, so why is
Prophet interesting? It caught our eye because the backend is implemented in
<a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>, a probabilistic programming language we researched
in <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/18/new-research-on-probabilistic-programming.html">our most recent
report</a>.</p>
<p>This choice means that Prophet offers many of the <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/30/the-algorithms-behind-probabilistic-programming.html">advantages of the Bayesian
approach</a>.
In particular, the models have a simple, interpretable structure (seasonality)
on which prior analyst knowledge can be imposed, and forecasts include
confidence intervals derived from the full posterior distribution, which means
they offer a data-driven estimate of risk.</p>
<p>But by keeping the probabilistic programming language in the backend, the
choice of Stan becomes an implementation detail to the user, who is probably a
data analyst with a time series modeling problem. This user can continue to
work entirely in a general purpose language they already know.</p>
<p>In this post, we take Prophet for a spin, exploring its user interface and
performance with a couple of datasets.</p>
<h2 id="the-model">The model</h2>
<p>Prophet implements a general purpose time series model suitable for the
kind of data seen at Facebook. It offers piecewise trends, multiple seasonality
(day of week, day of year, etc.), and floating holidays.</p>
<p>Prophet frames the time series forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise.
The dependent variable is a sum of three components: growth, periodic
seasonality, and holidays.</p>
<p>Prophet models nonlinear <strong>growth</strong> using a logistic growth model with a
time-varying carrying capacity. It models linear growth using a simple
piecewise constant function. Changepoints (where growth rate is allowed to
change) are modeled using a vector of rate adjustments, each corresponding to
a specific point in time. The rate adjustment variable is modeled using a
Laplace distribution with location parameter of 0. Analysts can specify
changepoints by providing specific dates or by adjusting the scale parameter
associated with the Laplace distribution.</p>
<p>Prophet models <strong>periodic seasonality</strong> using a standard Fourier series. For
yearly and weekly seasonality, the number of approximation terms is 20 and 6
respectively. The seasonal component is smoothed with a normal prior.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>holidays</strong> are modeled using an indicator function. The indicator
function takes 1 on holidays and is multiplied by a normal smoothing prior.</p>
<p>For both seasonal and holiday priors, analysts can adjust the spread parameter
to model how much of the historical seasonal variation is expected in the
future.</p>
<h2 id="using-prophet">Using Prophet</h2>
<p>The model is specified in <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/prophet/blob/master/python/stan/unix/prophet_linear_growth.stan">a short Stan
listing</a>
that gets compiled behind the scenes when the Prophet is first installed. The
user need never touch the Stan code, and works with Prophet entirely through
its Python or R interfaces.</p>
<p>To demonstrate these interfaces, let&rsquo;s run Prophet on an infamous dataset with
extremely strong seasonality: <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html">atmospheric carbon dioxide as measured on the
Hawaiian volcano of Mauna
Loa</a>.</p>
<p>Having prepared a pandas DataFrame <code>maunaloa</code>, running Prophet is just a couple
of lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">m <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Prophet()
m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit(maunaloa)
future <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>make_future_dataframe(periods<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">120</span>, freq<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m&#39;</span>)
forecast <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>predict(future)
</code></pre></div><p>This code takes a couple of seconds to run and yields the following forecast:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/maunaforecast.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Prophet&rsquo;s simple model is easily able to detect the strong annual periodicity
and long-term upwards trend. Note that the forecast comes with data-driven
confidence intervals for free, a crucial advantage of probabilistic programming
systems.</p>
<p>Prophet also yields simple, interpretable results for the components (date, day
of week, day of year) of the time series decomposition.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/maunacomponent.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice the weekly component is much smaller than the other two, and likely
mostly noise. This makes sense; global atmospheric chemistry doesn&rsquo;t vary by day
of the week! On the other hand, the yearly component shows the seasonal impact
of northern hemisphere vegetation levels on carbon dioxide levels; the levels
are higher lower after the summer and higher after winter.</p>
<h3 id="birth-data">Birth data</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now run Prophet on a more challenging dataset, the <a href="http://www.mechanicalkern.com/static/birthdates-1968-1988.csv">number of births in
the United States by day of the
year</a>. This
dataset was <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/slick-time-series-decomposition-of-the-birthdays-data/">analyzed using Gaussian
Processes</a>
and made famous through its appearance on the cover of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/">Bayesian Data
Analysis</a>, Andrew Gelman&rsquo;s
textbook. It&rsquo;s a dataset with seasonality (both yearly and weekly) and holiday
effects.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">m <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Prophet(changepoint_prior_scale<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0.1</span>)
m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit(birthdates);
future <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>make_future_dataframe(periods<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">365</span>)
forecast <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>predict(future)
</code></pre></div><p>Here we demonstrate Prophet&rsquo;s ability to automatically detect changepoints by
adjusting the changepoint smoothing parameter. Instead of the default value of
0.05, we set the changepoint smoothing parameter to be 0.1. This makes the
resulting forecast more flexible and less smooth, but also more susceptible for
chasing noise. If we were doing this for real we would of course conduct a
formal cross-validation to empirically determine the proper value of this
hyperparameter.</p>
<p>Prophet takes about a minute to run on this dataset (black points) and gives
the following forecast (blue line). We show here a truncated time series from 1987
to 1990.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/birthforecast.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see the origin of the almost bimodal distribution of the data in the
component plots. Prophet finds the strong weekday/weekend variation.
We also see the yearly seasonality effects: more births around
August to October.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/03/birthcomponent.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These components are very similar to the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/slick-time-series-decomposition-of-the-birthdays-data/">those found using Gaussian
Processes</a>.
That analysis finds spikes in the number of births on specific days during the
year. For example, the number of birth is anomalously low on New Year&rsquo;s day and
high on Valentine&rsquo;s Day. We stopped short of doing this, but these special days
could be captured in Prophet as &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; by defining a indicator variable
series that says whether each date covered by the dataset and forecast was/will
be a holiday.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-prophet">Advantages of Prophet</h2>
<p>In our probabilistic programming report we emphasized that the Bayesian
approach, made simpler by probabilistic languages like Stan and pymc3, allows
developers and statisticians to quantify the probability of all outcomes and
not just determine the most likely prediction. The prior and interpretability make the
models more practical.</p>
<p>Prophet makes these advantages concrete for a specific use case: forecasting.
It makes sensible choices for a general purpose time series modeling function.
Some flexibility is sacrificed in the modeling choices, but the trade-off is a
great one from the point of view of the intended typical Prophet user. It
abstracts away the complexity of working with Stan&rsquo;s powerful but somewhat
eccentric interfaces behind idiomatic Python and R APIs, which makes the system
even easier and quicker for data scientists and analysts to use. Prophet is a
great example of a robust, user-friendly probabilistic programming product.</p>
