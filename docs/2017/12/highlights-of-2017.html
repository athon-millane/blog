  <h1>Highlights of 2017</h1>
  <p>We end 2017 with a round-up of some of the research, talks, sci-fi,
visualizations/art, and a grab bag of other stuff we found particularly
interesting, enjoyable, or influential this year.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>2017 saw renewed interest in using the human brain as an inspiration for
machine learning &mdash; perhaps most notably, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829">Dynamic Routing Between Capsule
Networks</a> by Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton.</p>
<p>Somewhat to counter this trend (and Hinton&rsquo;s criticism of stochastic gradient
descent based on its biological implausibility) and to highlight necessary
foundational work, we recommend two papers from Arpit, JastrzÄ™bski, and
collaborators: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394">Memorization in Deep Neural
Networks</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04623">The Factors Influencing Minima
in SGD</a> (with practical suggestions for
developers) are beautiful examples of foundational work the field needs now
that neural networks have proven to be effective applied problem solvers.</p>
<p>Work on <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/koh17a.html">influence functions and adversarial
examples</a> helps us understand
both what neural networks learn <em>and</em> their fragility. As more models are
pushed into production, it&rsquo;s more important to understand the vulnerabilities.
Indeed <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/interpretability.html">our own
research</a>
built on separate academic work that highlighted the importance and value of of
model interpretability.</p>
<p>On the infrastructure and engineering side, we&rsquo;re excited about serverless in
general, and PyWren in particular. PyWren is a tool which uses a serverless
backend (AWS Lambda in this case) to offer data scientists a simple,
inexpensive and scalable mapreduce. PyWren is presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04024">Occupy the cloud:
distributed computing for the 99%</a>. The
upsides and downsides of serverless are examined in <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rbc/papers/fse-serverless-17.pdf">Serverless Computing:
Economic and Architectural
Impact</a>.</p>

<h5 id="image-credit-aaron-levin-at-conhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkkrvejrvvso">Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKRvEJrvvso">Aaron Levin at !!Con</a></h5>
<p>Aaron Levin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKRvEJrvvso">Finding Friends in High Dimensions: Locality-Sensitive Hashing
For Fun and Friendliness!</a> was a
fast (and funny!) introduction to an important algorithm. Aaron delivered this
talk at <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a>, which is hands-down our favorite
programming conference.</p>
<p>Joel Grus&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw">Livecoding Madness - Let&rsquo;s Build a Deep Learning
Library</a> was dazzling.</p>
<h3 id="sci-fi">Sci-fi</h3>
<p>N.K. Jemisin completed her Broken Earth trilogy with <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Stone-Sky-Broken-Earth-ebook/dp/B01N7EQOFA/">The Stone
Sky</a>, and
it was the best sci-fi we read this year. While not directly related to AI, it
explores consequences of a society shaped by technology inherited from the
past.</p>
<p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Autonomous-Annalee-Newitz/dp/0765392089">Autonomous</a>
by Annalee Newitz is an interesting look at bio-hacking and robot
relationships.</p>
<h3 id="visualizationart">Visualization/Art</h3>
<p><img src="/images/2017/12/musicvae.png" alt="Music VAE"></p>
<h5 id="image-credit-music-vaehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjnies3pdru4index1t3slistplbumaya6kvgu8cgqh709o5suvo-zhgtxr">Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNiES3pdrU4&amp;index=1&amp;t=3s&amp;list=PLBUMAYA6kvGU8Cgqh709o5SUvo-zHGTxr">Music VAE</a></h5>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kcimc">Kyle McDonald&rsquo;s twitter account</a> is not just about
visualization (e.g., his dispatches from NIPS were fascinating), but we
particularly love it when he shares his work looking at data. This thread on
<a href="https://twitter.com/kcimc/status/902229612666658816">how people draw everyday objects varies by
country</a>, and this thread showing
<a href="https://twitter.com/kcimc/status/893849886529003524">music tempo by year as a
heatmap</a> to demonstrate
the arrival of the drum machine, were highlights.</p>
<p>Speaking of the drum machine, the Google Brain team got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBUMAYA6kvGU8Cgqh709o5SUvo-zHGTxr">great-sounding
results</a>
with <a href="https://nips2017creativity.github.io/doc/Hierarchical_Variational_Autoencoders_for_Music.pdf">Music
VAE</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/">Zach Lieberman&rsquo;s visual sketches</a>
have been great, especially the AR stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo">Mario Kligemann</a> does interesting work with
Generative Adversarial Networks, among other things.</p>
<h3 id="everything-else">Everything else</h3>
<p><img src="/images/2017/12/universalpaperclips.png" alt="Universal Paperclips"></p>
<h5 id="image-credit-universal-paperclipshttpwwwdecisionproblemcompaperclips">Image credit: <a href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal Paperclips</a></h5>
<p>We thought about putting the web (and now mobile) game <a href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal
Paperclips</a> in the
sci-fi section of this list. It&rsquo;s a fun game to discover and beat, but it&rsquo;s
also a fascinating look at the infamous <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">Paperclip
Maximizer</a> artificial
intelligence thought experiment.</p>
<p>Data &amp; Society&rsquo;s report on <a href="https://datasociety.net/output/media-manipulation-and-disinfo-online/">Media Manipulation and Disinformation
Online</a>
shows how extremist groups attempt to hack the attention economy. And in a year
during which harassment and discrimination was never far from the news, <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">Susan
Fowler&rsquo;s powerful
testimony</a>
on her time at Uber and Leah Fessler&rsquo;s <a href="https://work.qz.com/1128150/your-companys-slack-is-probably-sexist/">Your company&rsquo;s Slack is probably
sexist</a>
were especially important to our community. We urge everyone who works in tech
to reflect on these pieces.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish you all a very happy holidays and look forward to sharing our
work with you next year!</p>
