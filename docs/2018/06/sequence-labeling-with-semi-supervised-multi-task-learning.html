  <h1>Sequence labeling with semi-supervised multi-task learning</h1>
  <p>Sequence labeling tasks attempt to assign a categorical label to each member in
the sequence. In natural language processing, where a sequence generally refers
to a sentence, examples of sequence labeling include named entity
recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (POS) and error detection. NER, as the
name implies, tries to recognize names in a sentence and classify them into
pre-defined labels such as <em>Person</em> and <em>Organization</em>. POS tagging assigns labels
such as <em>noun</em>, <em>verb</em>, and <em>adjective</em> to each word, while error detection identifies
grammatical errors in sentences. In many of these tasks, the relevant labels in
the dataset are very sparse and most of the words contribute very little to the
training process. But why let the data go to waste?</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07156">A recent
paper</a> proposes using multitask learning to
make more use of the available data. In addition to assigning labels to each
token (or words, loosely), the authors propose a model that also predicts the
surrounding words in the dataset. By adding the secondary unsupervised
objective, &ldquo;<em>the model is required to learn more general patterns of semantic and
syntactic composition, which can be reused in order to predict individual labels
more accurately</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For the sequence modeling neural network, the authors take one
sentence as input and use a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to assign a label to every token in the
sentence. Each sentence is first tokenized and the resulting tokens are mapped into a
sequence of word embeddings before being fed into the LSTM. Two LSTM components,
moving in opposite directions (forward and backward) through the sentence, are
then used for constructing context-dependent representations for every word. The
hidden representations from both LSTMs are concatenated in order to obtain a
context-specific representation for each word. This concatenated representation
is passed through a feed-forward layer, allowing the model to learn features
based on both context directions. To predict a label for each token, the authors
use either a softmax or conditional random field (CRF) output
architecture. Softmax predicts each label independently. CRF, on the other hand,
handles dependencies between subsequent labels by looking for the best label
sequence.</p>
<p>To predict the surrounding words, the authors cannot use the concatenated
(forward and backward) representation because it contains information on both
the previous word and next word. Instead, they use the pre-concatenated
version. The hidden representation from the forward-moving LSTM is used to
predict the next word; the hidden representation from the backward-moving LSTM
is used to predict the previous word.</p>

<p>The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of
error detection, named entity recognition, chunking, and POS-tagging. Introducing
a secondary task resulted in consistent performance improvements on every
benchmark. The largest benefit was observed on the task of error detection -
perhaps due to the very sparse and unbalanced label distribution in the dataset.</p>
