  <h1>Hyperparameter Tuning and Meta-Interpretability: Track All Your Experiments!</h1>
  <p>From random forest to neural networks, many modern machine learning algorithms involve a number of parameters that have to be fixed before training the
algorithm. These parameters, in contrast to the ones learned by the algorithm
during training, are called hyperparameters. The performance of a model on a
task given data depends on the specific values of these hyperparameters.</p>
<p>Hyperparamter tuning is the process of determining the hyperparameter values
that maximize model performance on a task given data. The tuning of
hyperparameters is done by machine learning experts, or increasingly, software
packages (e.g., <a href="http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/">HyperOpt</a>,
<a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/">auto-sklearn</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/automl/SMAC3">SMAC</a>). The aim of these libraries is to turn
hyperparameter tuning from a &ldquo;black art&rdquo;, requiring expert expertise and
sometimes brute-force search, into a reproducible science - reducing the need for
expert knowledge, whilst keeping computational complexity at bay (e.g.,<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization">Snoek,
Larochelle, &amp; Adams;
2012</a>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, hyperparameter tuning is done using grid search. Grid search
requires that we choose a set of values for each hyperparameter and evaluate
every possible combination of hyperparameter values. Grid search suffers from
the <em>curse of dimensionality</em>; the number of joint values grows exponentially
with the number of hyperparameters.</p>
<p>In 2012, <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html">Bergstra and Bengio</a>
showed that random hyperparameter search is more efficient than grid search, a
perhaps counter-intuitive result. This is because only a few hyperparameters
tend to really matter for the performance of a model on a task given data.
Grid search tends to spend more time in regions of the hyperparameter space
that are low-performing compared to random search. What&rsquo;s more, random search
allows one to easily add more experiments that explore even more sets of
hyperparameter values without (expensive) adjustment of the grid (most
recently, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf">sequential
approaches</a>
have shown great promise).</p>

With random search, all nine trials explore distinct values of the hyperparameters. Random search is more efficient. (Picture taken from Bergstra and Bengio, 2012)</h5>
<p>If only a few hyperparameter values really matter, for a given model on a task
given data, what are those parameters and what are their values? Current
software libraries for hyperparameter tuning do not tend to discriminate
important from unimportant hyperparameters and/or do not expose important
parameters and their values. This limits insights into the workings of a
model - which is important for a variety of reasons, as we explain in depth in
our report on <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/interpretability.html">model
interpretability</a>;
interpretability allows us to verify, for example, that a model gives high
quality predictions for the right, and not the wrong, reasons.</p>
<p>A series of recent papers tackles this <em>&ldquo;meta-interpretability&rdquo; problem</em>: what
hyperparameters matter for model performance on a task given data? In
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04725"><em>Hyperparameter Importance Across
Datasets</em></a>, Jan van Rijn and Frank Hutter
first evaluate a model on a task given data and a set of randomly chosen
hyperparameters to assess model performance. They then use these
hyperparameters as inputs to a model, a so-called surrogate model, that they
train to predict the oberved performance. Given a trained surrogate model, they
predict model performance for hyperparameters not previously included in their
experiments. Finally, they conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine
how much of the predicted model performance by the surrogate model can be
explained by each hyperparameter or combination of hyperparameters. To draw
conclusions across data sets, a more generalizable result, the authors repeat
this procedure across several data sets. For random forests, for example, they
find that only the <code>minimum samples per leaf</code> and the <code>maximum numbers of features</code> really matter. This finding is consistent with expert knowledge,
which is great: it validates the method; we can use it to study more
complex models for which we have no such intuition yet while it helps beginners
to get started.</p>
<p>Using a related approach also based on surrogate models, Philipp Probst, Bernd
Bischl, and Anne-Laure Boulesteix
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09596">demonstrate</a> that some default values of
hyperparameters as set by software packages (e.g., scikit-learn) lie
outside the range of hyperparameter values that tend to yield optimal model
performance across tasks and data; we can use solutions to the
meta-interpretability problem to define better default values, or to define
prior distributions for even more efficient random hyperparameter search
(Bergtra and Bengio sample from a uniform distribution which we can replace by
a &ldquo;more informed&rdquo; distribution).</p>
<p>Within organizations, these results suggest that one should track and store the
results of hyperparameter tuning - not only the set of parameters that result in
the best performing model, but <em>all</em> results. These results can be used to
train surrogate models that allow us insight into the importance of
hyperparameter values and increase the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by
defining sensible default values (or distributions) for the classes of problems
tackled by data teams at these organizations.</p>
