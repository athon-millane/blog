  <h1>Automating Weak Supervision</h1>
  <h3 id="what-is-weak-supervision">What is weak supervision?</h3>
<p>We recently explored Snorkel, a weak supervision framework for learning when
there are limited high-quality labels (see <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/08/snorkel_final.html">blog
post</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/snorkel-demo-colab/blob/master/snorkel_demo.ipynb">notebook</a>). To use Snorkel, subject
matter experts first write labeling functions to programmatically create
labels. Very often these labeling functions attempt to capture heuristics. The
labels are then fed into a generative model. The job of the generative model is
to estimate the accuracy of the labeling functions while automatically taking
into account the pairwise correlation between these functions and labeling
propensity (how often a function actually creates a label). Once the generative
model is trained, it can be used to estimate the true label for each
candidate. The generative model outputs probabilistic labels - numbers between 0
and 1, representing the probability of a positive class. These probabilistic
labels can be used to train any end model with a <em>noise-aware</em> loss.</p>
<p>Writing these labeling functions is sometimes not straight-forward; it can be
time consuming and expensive. The idea behind
Snuba (<a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p223-varma.pdf">PDF</a>) is to create a system
to &ldquo;automatically generate heuristics using a small labeled dataset to assign
training labels to a large unlabeled dataset.&rdquo; The labels generated by all these
heuristics then feed into a weak supervision framework.</p>
<h3 id="automatically-generating-heuristics">Automatically generating heuristics</h3>
<p>Doing this step automatically requires replacing human reasoning that drives
heuristic development. The authors take their cue from how humans generate heuristics
in order to automate this process. From their observations, subject matter
experts often fiddle with the correct threshold for each heuristic in order to
make a correct classification. Radiologists, for example, try to figure out a
threshold for each heuristic that uses a geometric property of a tumor in order
to determine if it is malignant. In addition, subject matter experts tend to
develop a single heuristic to assign accurate labels to a <em>subset</em> of the
unlabeled data; covering the entire set of unlabeled data requires multiple
heuristics. Lastly, humans stop generating heuristics when they have exhausted
their domain knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="inner-workings-of-snuba">Inner workings of Snuba</h3>
<p>The proposed system works as follows, and requires a small set of labeled data
to begin. The labeled data is first transformed into primitives (or
features). For tumor images, this might mean numerical features such as area of
perimeter of tumor. For text data, this might be one-hot vectors for the bag of
words representation. Once we have the primitives, Snuba iteratively generates
heuristics on a subset of the input data. Each iteration results in a new
heuristic specialized to the subset of data that did not receive high confidence
labels from the existing set of heuristics. In addition, the system knows when
to stop. All these are accomplished using a three part architecture: synthesizer, pruner, and verifier.</p>

<h4 id="synthesizer">Synthesizer</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The synthesizer takes as input the labeled dataset, or a subset of the labeled
dataset after the first iteration, and outputs a <em>candidate</em> set of
heuristics.&rdquo; Each heuristic is actually a classification model - a decision
stump, a logistic regressor, or a k_nearest neighbor classifier. These models
take in primitives (feature representation of the original datapoint) and assign
probabilistic labels to the data points. For binary classification,
these are probabilities that the input primitive is a 1 (positive label) or a
-1 (negative label).</p>

<p>These probabilistic labels need to be turned into an actual label (since that&rsquo;s
what a human tries to do with heuristics). A straightforward approach to use
probability = 0.5 as a threshold. Any probability less than 0.5 is considered a
negative label, any probability above 0.5 is considered a positive label. Snuba
builds in a threshold <em>beta</em> around 0.5, so anything greater than 0.5 + <em>beta</em>
is a positive label, and anything less than 0.5 - <em>beta</em> is a negative
label. All other values result in an &ldquo;abstained&rdquo; label. The system tries to find
the <em>beta</em> that maximizes the F1 score on the <em>labeled</em> dataset. It does so by
iterating through equally spaced values in <em>beta</em> (between 0 and 0.5),
calculating the F1 score the heuristic achieves, and selecting <em>beta</em> that
maximizes the F1 score. In doing so, Snuba is using the heuristic performance on
the small labeled dataset as a proxy for the heuristic performance on the large
unlabeled data set.</p>
<h4 id="pruner">Pruner</h4>
<p>The pruner takes multiple candidate heuristics from the synthesizer and selects
one to add to the existing set of heuristics. The goal is to select heuristics
that label data points which have never received a label from other
heuristics. At the same time, the selected heuristics should perform well when
applied to the labeled dataset. To do this, the pruner uses a weighted average of
Jaccard distance and F1 score to select the highest ranking heuristic from the
candidate set.</p>
<h4 id="verifier">Verifier</h4>
<p>The verifier takes care of the stopping condition. It uses the label aggregator
(the generative model) to produce a single, probabilistic training label for each
datapoint in the unlabeled dataset. It also identifies data points in the labeled
dataset that receive low confidence labels (probability being close to 0.5). The
verifier passes this subset to the synthesizer with the assumption that similar
data . points in the unlabeled dataset would have also received low confidence
labels. The stopping condition is met &ldquo;if i) a statistical measure suggests the
generative model in the synthesizer is not learning the accuracies of the
heuristics properly, or ii) there are no low confidence data points in the small,
labeled dataset.&rdquo; The statistical measure uses the small, labeled dataset to
indirectly determine whether the generated heuristics are worse than random for
the unlabeled dataset.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-work">Does it work?</h3>
<p>The authors show that training labels from Snuba outperform labels from
semi-supervised learning and from user-developed heuristics in terms of end
model performance for tasks across various domains. These tasks include image
classification and text and multi-modal classification.</p>
<p>In some ways Snuba reminds us of active learning - the iterative nature, the
need for a stopping condition and the labeled dataset requirement. Active
learning relies on the initial small labeled dataset to build a learner (or a
model). A selection strategy then picks out data points that are difficult for the
model and requests labels for them. The labeled data points (labeled by humans)
are added back to the small labeled dataset and the process repeats. The learner
gets better as a result. Snuba relies on the initial small labeled dataset to
create some heuristics, and continues to use the same small labeled dataset to
add more heuristics while evaluating diversity using the unlabeled dataset. Both
need a stopping condition and Snuba&rsquo;s stopping condition is better defined. We
think Snuba seems promising, but wonder about the effect of generalizing from a
small, labeled dataset to a large, unlabeled dataset.</p>
