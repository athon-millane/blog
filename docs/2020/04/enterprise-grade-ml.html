  <h1>Enterprise Grade ML</h1>
  <p>At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple
machine learning research with application is through <a href="https://www.cloudera.com/about/services-and-support/fast-forward-labs.html">application development
projects</a> for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these
projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a
production system that translates data into business impact.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-enterprise-grade-machine-learning">What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning?</h3>
<p>Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00084">a paper put forth by
Microsoft</a>, refers to ML applications where
there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user
privacy, and debuggability. While toy problems that data scientists solve on
laptops using a csv dataset could be intellectually challenging, they are not
enterprise grade machine learning problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-current-state-of-enterprise-grade-ml">The current state of Enterprise Grade ML</h3>
<p>In many of our projects, the most difficult portion is understanding the
business problem and defining a mathematical version that can be solved with the
data that is available. Sometimes this mathematical version is not what the
business stakeholders imagined it to be - this version might only partially
solve the original business problem due to data realities. Very often, the
business problem is broken down into smaller subproblems. The output of these
subproblems then feed into a thin layer of business logic/rules to arrive at a
final model output.</p>
<p>Once the problem is clearly defined, and data is flowing properly into the
modeling environment, building a model is rather straightforward. When model
building becomes convoluted, it can be taken as an indicator of an incorrect
problem formulation. There are various ways to approach model building (feature
creation, model selection, experimentation) ranging from fully custom approaches
to highly automated processes. We are partial to the old-school
Python-leveraging-packages approach but can envision the usefulness of AutoML if
a data scientist has strong intuition about the business problem and solid
understanding of the dataset.</p>
<p>In deployment (via containers or spark applications, for example), governance
becomes paramount, especially in regulated environments. Data lineage, data
versioning, model versioning, model explainability, model monitoring are all
front and center.</p>
<p>Today, we very often need to stitch together ad hoc tools to accomplish all the
above. What does the future look like?  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00084">A recent paper</a> outlines a 10-year
prediction for enterprise-grade ML. Along the lines of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software
2.0</a>, the authors view
ML models as software derived from data. Most of us in the ML space would agree
with this view, and would also acknowledge that even though ML is software, in
today&rsquo;s practice we don&rsquo;t yet (always) adopt known best practices in software
development.</p>
<h3 id="future-state-for-enterprise-grade-ml">Future state for Enterprise-Grade ML</h3>
<p>The authors look to the future from three perspectives: i) model
development/training ii) model scoring and iii) model management/governance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/03/Screen_Shot_2020_03_27_at_4_17_39_PM-1585340376058.png" alt="Reference architecture for canonical data science lifecycle (Flock) src"></p>
<h5 id="reference-architecture-for-canonical-data-science-lifecycle-flock-image-source-httpsarxivorgabs190900084">Reference architecture for canonical data science lifecycle (Flock). Image Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00084">https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00084</a></h5>
<p>On model development/training, they believe training and development work will
move to the cloud, either private or public. This is consistent with our
observations.</p>
<p>On governance, the authors believe that all data, including deployed models (to
be thought of as derived data) and inferences made using them will need to be
robustly governed. This is something we attempt to do in our current projects -
capture code that trained the model, training data that went into it, model
inference results - albeit in an ad hoc/brittle way, depending on existing
architecture.</p>
<p>The most interesting viewpoint (to me) is their perspective on model
scoring. Because machine learning models are software artifacts derived from
data, the dual nature of software artifacts and derived data suggests that the
boundary between the data world and the modeling world will be fuzzy. The
authors believe that inference pipelines will be close to data, and inference on
data stored in a database management system should be done as an extension of
the query runtime. In other words, models should be represented as first-class
data types in a database management system. To investigate this, they
&ldquo;integrated ONNX Runtime (a performance-focused inference engine for ONNX)
within SQL server and developed an in-database cross-optimizer between SQL and
ML to enable optimizations across hybrid relational and ML expressions.&rdquo; Early
results indicate that in-database management system inference is very promising.</p>
<p>As ML adoption quickens within enterprises and ML drives many business
decisions, the attention will shift to effects of these models. To reach a state
where ML models are defensible (privacy, security, interpretability, speed)
without much technical debt, the DB community and the ML community will both
shape the future of these ML end-to-end pipelines.</p>
