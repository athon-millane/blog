      <description>Since we released our text summarization resources, the legal technology community has shown interestin leveraging summarization technology to support litigation document review, deposition digests, and contract analysis. Data scientist interest to use machine learning to mine legal document corpuses and support legal strategy was also one factor motivating our summarization research. The time is therefore ripe for data scientists to apply new text analytics capabilities for legal use cases. But to be effective, data scientists must first understand how lawyers think: what problems theyâ€™re trying to solve, how their processes are structured, and, perhaps most importantly, what fears may hinder the adoption of new technologies.</description>
